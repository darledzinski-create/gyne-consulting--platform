    <p>
        Online gynaecological consultations can be very helpful for many concerns.
        However, there are situations where a face-to-face medical assessment,
        urgent care, or referral to another healthcare professional is necessary
        to ensure your safety and wellbeing.
    </p>

    <h2>When online consultation may not be sufficient</h2>

    <p>
        You may be advised to seek in-person medical care, urgent assessment,
        or referral if:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Your symptoms suggest an acute or potentially serious medical condition</li>
        <li>A physical examination is required to make a safe diagnosis</li>
        <li>Investigations such as blood tests, scans, or swabs are necessary</li>
        <li>Your symptoms worsen or do not improve as expected</li>
        <li>Your concern falls outside the scope of safe online management</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight">
        <p>
            If at any point your symptoms are severe, rapidly worsening,
            or you are concerned about your immediate health,
            you should seek urgent medical attention through local emergency
            services or your nearest emergency department.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Specialist and GP referral</h2>

    <p>
        Where appropriate, you may be advised to consult:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Your General Practitioner (GP)</li>
        <li>A local gynaecologist or relevant medical specialist</li>
        <li>Emergency medical services</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This recommendation is always made in your best interest
        and does not mean your concern is unimportant — only that
        it requires a different level of care.
    </p>
