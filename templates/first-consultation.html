        <h1>First Consultation</h1>
        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <p>
            The first consultation is designed to allow you the space and time to
            describe your concern in your own words, at your own pace.
            Your narrative is central to the consultation process.
        </p>

        <p>
            During this consultation, you will be listened to carefully and,
            where appropriate, certain aspects of your history may be explored
            further through gentle and focused questioning.
        </p>

        <h2>What the Consultation Includes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Careful review of your written consultation request</li>
            <li>Clarification of symptoms and relevant medical history</li>
            <li>Explanation of possible causes and medical context</li>
            <li>Professional guidance and recommendations</li>
            <li>Discussion of next steps, investigations, or referrals if required</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Medical Advice and Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            If a medical remedy is considered appropriate and safe based on the
            information provided, this will be explained clearly.
            Treatment options will always be discussed before any recommendation is made.
        </p>

        <p>
            If your concern requires in-person assessment, specialist referral,
            or urgent care, you will be advised accordingly.
        </p>

        <h2>What the Consultation Does Not Replace</h2>
        <p>
            Online consultation does not replace emergency care or physical examination
            where these are clinically necessary.
        </p>

            <strong>Personal Note:</strong>
            <p>
                My aim is to create a respectful, calm, and thoughtful consultation space
                where you feel heard, informed, and supported in making decisions
                about your health.
