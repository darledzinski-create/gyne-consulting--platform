    <h1>First Consultation Package</h1>

    <p>
        Your first consultation is designed to give you the time, privacy, and professional
        attention needed to understand your concern properly.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is a medical consultation — not a rushed exchange of messages.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 1: Your Story</h2>
    <p>
        You are invited to describe your concern in your own words.
        There is no need to use medical terminology.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>when the problem started</li>
        <li>how it has changed over time</li>
        <li>what improves or worsens it</li>
        <li>relevant medical history or medication</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 2: Clarifying Questions</h2>
    <p>
        After reviewing your message, I may ask follow-up questions to clarify important details.
        This is a normal and essential part of good medical care.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 3: Medical Explanation</h2>
    <p>
        I will explain what may be happening medically, what conditions are being considered,
        and what can reasonably be assessed through telemedicine.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 4: Advice and Management</h2>
    <p>
        If appropriate, you may receive medical advice, reassurance,
        or recommendations for further assessment.
    </p>

    <h2>Important Limitations</h2>
    <p>
        Online consultations do not replace physical examination where required and are not
        suitable for acute or emergency conditions.
    </p>

    <div class="note">
        <strong>Personal Note</strong><br>
        This service is built on careful listening, respect, and professional integrity.
        You will be treated as a person — not a checklist.
