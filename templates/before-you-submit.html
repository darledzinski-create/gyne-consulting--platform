    <h1>Before You Submit Your Question</h1>

    <p>
        This online consultation service is designed to provide thoughtful, professional medical guidance
        in a calm and confidential setting.  
        To help you receive the most useful response, please take a moment to read the information below
        before submitting your question.
    </p>

    <h2>What this service is best suited for</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Non-urgent gynaecological concerns</li>
        <li>Clarification of symptoms, test results, or diagnoses</li>
        <li>Discussion of treatment options or next steps</li>
        <li>Second opinions or reassurance</li>
        <li>Guidance on whether further examination or referral may be required</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What this service cannot provide</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Emergency or urgent medical care</li>
        <li>Immediate diagnosis without appropriate examination or investigations</li>
        <li>Care for acute or rapidly worsening symptoms</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If you are experiencing acute pain, heavy bleeding, fever, fainting, or any other concerning
        symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention from local emergency services or your nearest
        healthcare provider.
    </p>

    <h2>How to write your question</h2>
    <p>
        You are encouraged to describe your concern in your own words.  
        Helpful details may include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Your age</li>
        <li>Relevant medical or gynaecological history</li>
        <li>Current symptoms and how long they have been present</li>
        <li>Any treatments or medications you are using</li>
        <li>What specifically you would like guidance or clarification on</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        There is no need to worry about medical terminology — clarity and honesty are far more important.
    </p>

    <h2>What happens after you submit</h2>
    <p>
        Once your question is received, it will be reviewed carefully.  
        You may receive clarifying questions before advice is provided, as this helps ensure that any
        guidance offered is appropriate and safe.
    </p>
