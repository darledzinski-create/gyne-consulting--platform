        <h2>1. Purpose of This Online Service</h2>
        <p>
            This platform provides general gynaecological advice and guidance based on the information you choose to share.
            It is intended to support your health decisions — not replace a face-to-face consultation when one is required.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Limitations of Online Advice</h2>
        <p>
            Online consultations have limitations. Without a physical examination, certain conditions cannot be diagnosed with complete certainty.
            You may be advised to see your GP or a specialist for an in-person assessment if needed.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Accuracy of Information Provided</h2>
        <p>
            The quality of medical guidance depends entirely on the accuracy and completeness of the information you provide.
            Please include all relevant symptoms, medical history, and concerns.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Not for Emergencies or Acute Problems</h2>
        <p>
            This service must not be used for emergencies or acute medical issues.
            If you experience severe pain, heavy bleeding, fainting, difficulty breathing, or any worrying symptoms,
            please contact emergency services or attend the nearest medical facility immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Privacy and Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>
            All information shared through this platform is handled confidentially.
            However, electronic communication can never be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
            By using this service, you acknowledge these limitations.
        </p>

        <h2>6. No Prescriptions Without Appropriate Assessment</h2>
        <p>
            Prescriptions, sick notes, and medical certificates are only provided when clinically appropriate
            and in accordance with professional and legal obligations.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Acceptance of These Terms</h2>
        <p>
            By submitting a consultation request through this platform, you confirm that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have read and understood this Disclaimer & Terms of Use.</li>
            <li>You understand the limitations of online consultations.</li>
            <li>You agree to use this service responsibly and honestly.</li>
        </ul>
