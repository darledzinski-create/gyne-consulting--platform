    <h2>Purpose of This Service</h2>
    <p>
        This online gynaecological consultation service is designed to provide
        medical advice, assessment, explanation and guidance based on the
        information you choose to share.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is intended to <strong>support</strong> — not replace — face-to-face
        medical care.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Ongoing Medical Care</h2>
    <p>
        Your <strong>General Practitioner (GP)</strong> or usual healthcare provider
        remains central to your long-term care.
    </p>
    <p>
        In some situations, online consultation alone may not be sufficient.
        When this is the case, you may be advised to seek further care.
    </p>

    <h2>When GP Review Is Recommended</h2>
    <p>You may be advised to contact your GP if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your symptoms persist, worsen, or recur</li>
        <li>A physical examination is required</li>
        <li>Monitoring or follow-up is necessary</li>
        <li>Investigations such as blood tests or imaging are appropriate</li>
        <li>A prescription requires local supervision</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When Specialist Referral Is Advised</h2>
    <p>Specialist referral may be recommended when:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>There are warning signs (“red flags”)</li>
        <li>The diagnosis remains uncertain</li>
        <li>Symptoms do not respond to initial advice</li>
        <li>Further specialist expertise is required</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If specialist referral is advised, you will be encouraged to arrange this
        through your GP or local healthcare system.
    </p>

    <h2>Patient Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
        By using this service, you understand that:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You may be advised to seek further medical care</li>
        <li>It is your responsibility to act on referral advice given</li>
        <li>You may share consultation information with your GP if appropriate</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
        <strong>Important:</strong> Online consultations work best when they are
        part of coordinated, ongoing medical care.
    </div>

    <h2>Emergency & Acute Matters</h2>
    <p>
        This service <strong>does not provide emergency care</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you experience acute symptoms — such as severe pain, heavy bleeding,
        collapse, chest pain, or sudden deterioration — you must seek immediate
        local medical attention.
    </p>

    <h2>Continuity of Care Statement</h2>
    <p>
        This platform aims to complement existing healthcare, promote
        understanding, and support informed decision-making.
    </p>
    <p>
        Good medicine depends on continuity, communication, and collaboration —
        this service is one part of that process.
