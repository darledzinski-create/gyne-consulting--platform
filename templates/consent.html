<h1>Telemedicine Consent</h1>

<div class="container">
    

    <p>
        This Telemedicine Consent outlines the nature, limitations, benefits, and risks of remote gynaecological consultation.
        By continuing to use this platform, you confirm your understanding and acceptance of the following:
    </p>

    <h2>1. Nature of Telemedicine</h2>
    <p>
        Telemedicine enables a medical consultation without a physical face-to-face examination. Advice is based solely on the information you provide.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Limitations</h2>
    <p>
        Without a physical examination or diagnostic tests, some conditions cannot be accurately diagnosed or treated.
        You accept that recommendations may be limited compared to an in-person assessment.
        Learn what to expect from your initial assessment in our
        <a href="/first-consultation"> First Consultation Package</a>a>
    </p>

    <h2>3. Benefits</h2>
    <p>
        • Efficient access to medical advice  
        • Private and confidential communication  
        • No need for travel or waiting rooms  
    </p>

    <h2>4. Risks</h2>
    <p>
        • Technical failures (internet, email, platform availability)  
        • Misinterpretation of symptoms due to incomplete information  
        • The possibility that telemedicine may not be appropriate for your condition  
    </p>

    <h2>5. Acute Medical Conditions</h2>
    <p>
        Telemedicine is not suitable for <strong>acute or emergency gynaecological problems</strong>.
        If you experience severe pain, heavy bleeding, fever, or any rapidly worsening symptoms, you must seek in-person medical care or attend the nearest emergency facility.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>
        All information you submit is handled with strict confidentiality. Electronic communication, while safeguarded, may still carry
        minimal security risks inherent to digital communication.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your Consent</h2>
    <p>
        By submitting a question or using this service, you confirm that:  
        • You are over 18 years old  
        • You understand the limitations of telemedicine  
        • You voluntarily consent to receive care through this platform  
        • You accept personal responsibility for the accuracy of the information you provide  
    </p>
