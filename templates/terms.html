    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>

    <p>
        These Terms of Use govern your access to and use of the Gynae Consulting Platform.
        By using this website or submitting a consultation request, you confirm that you
        have read, understood, and agreed to these terms.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Nature of the Service</h2>
    <p>
        This platform provides informational and advisory medical guidance in the field of
        gynaecology. It does <strong>not</strong> replace an in-person medical consultation,
        physical examination, or emergency medical care.
    </p>

    <h2>2. No Emergency or Acute Care</h2>
    <div class="note">
        This service must <strong>not</strong> be used for acute, urgent, or emergency medical
        matters. If you experience severe pain, heavy bleeding, sudden deterioration,
        or any emergency symptoms, seek immediate medical care from local emergency services.
    </div>

    <h2>3. Medical Limitations</h2>
    <p>
        Advice provided is based solely on the information you choose to share.
        Incomplete, inaccurate, or delayed information may affect the quality of guidance.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Prescriptions and Medical Documents</h2>
    <p>
        The platform does not guarantee:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Issuance of prescriptions</li>
        <li>Sick notes or medical certificates</li>
        <li>Formal diagnoses without appropriate assessment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Any such documents, if considered, remain entirely at the clinician’s discretion
        and may require an in-person consultation.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>
        Reasonable steps are taken to protect your information. However, electronic
        communication carries inherent risks. By using this platform, you acknowledge
        and accept these risks.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Patient Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
        You remain responsible for your own health decisions and for seeking appropriate
        in-person medical care when advised.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>
        These Terms of Use are governed by applicable professional and legal standards.
        Use of this platform does not establish a doctor-patient relationship in jurisdictions
        where such a relationship requires in-person assessment.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
        These terms may be updated periodically. Continued use of the platform constitutes
        acceptance of the current version.
