    <h1>Prescription Policy</h1>

    <p>
        This page explains how prescriptions are handled on the Gynae Consulting Platform,
        and what patients can reasonably expect from an online consultation.
    </p>

    <h2>General Principles</h2>
    <p>
        Prescriptions are issued only when, in my professional judgement, it is safe,
        appropriate, and clinically justified to do so.
        An online consultation does not automatically guarantee that a prescription will be provided.
    </p>

    <h2>When Prescriptions May Be Issued</h2>
    <p>
        A prescription may be considered when:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A clear and sufficient medical history has been provided</li>
        <li>The condition is suitable for remote assessment</li>
        <li>No physical examination is required for safe prescribing</li>
        <li>The medication is appropriate for remote initiation or continuation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When Prescriptions Cannot Be Issued</h2>
    <p>
        Prescriptions will <strong>not</strong> be issued when:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The condition requires physical examination or investigations</li>
        <li>The clinical information provided is incomplete or unclear</li>
        <li>The medication requested is unsafe without face-to-face assessment</li>
        <li>The request falls outside accepted medical or regulatory guidelines</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Controlled and Restricted Medications</h2>
    <p>
        Controlled drugs, addictive medications, and certain high-risk treatments
        cannot be prescribed through this platform.
        Patients requesting such medications will be advised to consult their local GP or specialist.
    </p>

    <h2>Follow-Up and Ongoing Care</h2>
    <p>
        Some prescriptions may require follow-up consultations or coordination with your GP.
        Long-term prescribing is normally managed by your primary care provider.
    </p>

    <div class="notice">
        <strong>Please note:</strong><br>
        Your safety is always the priority. If prescribing is not appropriate,
        clear explanations and alternative recommendations will be provided.
